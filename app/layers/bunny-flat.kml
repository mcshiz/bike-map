                To access the trailhead for this ride park at Bunny Flats and hike the trail on the rightside of the parking lot.After a quarter mile follow the sign that says "Horse Camp Left". Continue on that trail for a few hundred yards and the bike trail will be on your left side. This trail is fast and flows well with no major obsticles or jumps. The end of this trail will connect you to the Red Fir or Sand Flat trail (not mapped). Start on this trail for a really good long downhill ride.
