Mount Shasta Area Bike Trails

Things to do:


Get everything out of the controllers and seperate into directives/services/factories.

Stop using two seperate objects for the layers. Include geoXmlDoc[l] into $scope.allTrails so I can keep my sanity,

Use $scope.allTrails for every function rather than passing poly, polyNum and layer around.

Build modal to popup for adding new comments.

Figure out some sort of localstorage or use cache manifest to store layers locally for quicker load times

minimize. minimize. minimize. then concat for quick load times on crappy mobile connections.

MAP MORE TRAILS.. YAY.
